    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a steak recipe that looks super yummy.</p>
    <p>The recipe and picture are from What's Gabby Cooking. My wife and I generally trust recipes from her.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound skirt steak</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons chipotle powder, divided</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lime juice, divided and the zest reserved</li>
        <li>6 green onions</li>
        <li>2 ears of corn, husked</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped chives</li>
        <li>8 small street taco sized flour tortillas</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare an indoor or outdoor grill over medium-high heat. Sprinkle skirt steak on both sides with salt, pepper and and 1 1/4 teaspoons chipotle powder. Whisk 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil and 1 tablespoon lime juice in 11Ã—7-inch glass dish. Add meat and turn to coat. Marinate for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, brush green onions and corn with 1 tablespoon oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill vegetables until slightly charred, turning occasionally, about 2 minutes for green onions and 7 minutes for corn. Cut the corn from cob and transfer the kernels to a bowl. Chop green onions and add to corn. Stir in cilantro, chives, lime zest, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon chipotle powder, 1/2 tablespoon oil, and 1 tablespoon lime juice. Season relish to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Grill the skirt steak to desired doneness, about 2 1/2 minutes per side for medium. Transfer to work surface; let rest 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Char tortillas over an open flame.</li>
        <li>Thinly slice the skirt steak across grain. Divide skirt steak and juices equally among tortillas. Spoon corn mixture over each and serve.</li>
    </ol>
